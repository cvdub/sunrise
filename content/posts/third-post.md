Got the chance to see Carl Cox play a disco set last weekend in Bali, which was amazing (obviously haha). People probably thought I was lame for being on my phone so much, but I couldn't help but Shazam all the deep cuts!

"Papa Was A Rollin' Stone" by The Temptations was my favorite. You'll probably recognize the guitar riff. I'm pretty sure I've heard it in a movie.
