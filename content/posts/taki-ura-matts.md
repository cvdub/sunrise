I'm actually posting something by a band! It's still pretty wook though haha.

Very groovy, danceable song with a catchy vocal hook. I love the interplay between the violin and funky wild-west sounding guitar. Similar vibe to "Time for Space" by Emancipator. These vibes would be on point for an LIB day party.
