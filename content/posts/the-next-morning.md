Check out this dub techo banger released on Lucidflow, one of my favorite labels. This track is extremely delicate and restrained, and I think you need some decent speakers/headphones to appreciate the full level of detail. The melody that comes in right after the vocal sample at 2:40 is my favorite part, but it's so minimal it's actually easy miss if you aren't paying attention.

Like all dub techno, this song really does sound better with some THC in your system (even more so than other genres). The delays and reverbs synergize so well with a high brain.

Great track for a late, hazy, spaced-out kinda night.
