This track is super euphoric. It was released on Watergate Records, but it could easily be an ADID track.

The synths in the background really capture this feeling I had looking around the playa as the sun was coming up that's really hard to put into words. The best way I can describe it is like the music and and energy of the crowd being cast like spell and pulsing into the atmosphere.
