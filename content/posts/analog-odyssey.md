This would be a great early song in a techno set. It starts off slow and ominous, with cool vocal sample, and slowly builds from there. It really gets epic around 3:50 when the Stephan Bodzinish synths come in.

I would definitely call this track techno, but the drums have a strong tech-house vibe that makes the rhythm catchy and easy to groove along with.
