Tired of tech house? Looking for vibes?

Psychemagik's Magik Sunset compilation has some great rock tracks that are still dance floor appropriate. Think [Desert Raven](https://open.spotify.com/track/6kEG9Z53LEdIgkT3trjSpS?si=E15mtLghQrq8D3imGrom6Q).

Misunderstood by Greg Sonnleitner is my favorite track from the album, with Horizon by Jake Hottell coming in a close second.

In case you forgot about Psychemagik, they are the one with the killer [Fleetwood Mac Dreams remix](https://soundcloud.com/tjwilliams-961099352/fleetwood-mac-dreams-psychemagik-remix).
