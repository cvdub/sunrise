The groovy beat grabs my ear right from the start, and, as soon as the ominous bass line rumbles, I buckle up, ready to see where this rocket will land. To my pleasant surprise, I arrive at the Galactic Ocean, deep in sector 69. Cosmic synth-fish dart to and fro, and space whales sound their call, dancing in their slow, strange way to the pulsing rhythms.

What a trip!
