I've really been digging this album. Super fresh and experimental, while still sounding fun and familiar. Reminds me a lot of Moderat actually, but with more of a hip-hop/trap influence. I'm not a huge fan of Flying Lotus tbh, but I think Ross from Friends is a great pick up for his label.

Favorite track: R.A.T.S.
