Ease into the workweek with this chill EP by Abakus. Vibes is right.

Favorite track: Blueskies - 2020 Edit

Abakaus is a downtempo/psychill artist with top notch production/mastering skills. If you like this EP, definitely check out his 2011 album That Much Closer to the Sun. I've seen it on quite a few top ten lists for psychill albums, and the accolades are well deserved.
